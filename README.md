## Weight Tracker Application

Created by: Ami Akagi



### Artifact Overview

This is the code and design completed for the Weight Tracker app, which was created for Project Three. The UI design first made in Project Two formed a basis for the app.


### App Requirements and Goals

Weight Tracker is an app to easily log and track your weight over time. The purpose of this article is to help them track their trends of weight, and support to manage the health. It is specifically designed for users with fitness, weight loss or overall good health in mind.

### User Centred Design: Main Screens and Functionality
- Login/Signup Screen: Allows users to create an account or log in securely to track their personal weight data.
- Dashboard: Displays a list of body weight history and includes a footer with a button to open a modal popup for quickly adding a new body weight entry.
- Settings Screen: Provides access to notification settings and the ability to send SMS notifications to users for reminders or updates.

The User Interface was created to be clear, intuitive and unobtrusive so as to ensure that users can find their way and get to the information they need immediately. The design aimed to reduce the number of steps involved in task completion, in order to increase usability and user satisfaction.

### Coding Approach
I was following an iterative development process of adding and testing each of the features. One of the most important things to me was writing clean and modular code, by putting logical units of work in functions / classes. In the days and years ahead, this small-steps and gentle-refinement approach will allow me to reliably manage bigger and more complicated projects.

### Testing and Importance
I manually checked every significant feature (adding, saving, and displaying weight entries, for instance) when I developed the app. This testing helped identify small bugs in the early part of the process, like problems with syncing data and display errors. Robustly testing codes to guarantee functionalty is essential to eprserve a seamless user experience.

### Challenges and Innovations
A difficult obstacle was how to handle synchronizing between saving data and updating the UI. To address that, I added "async" functionality (meaning better use of await) to maintain smooth, correct data handling. That made the app much better and more stable.

### Areas of Success
I’m particularly proud of the chart feature where it shows the user weight trends. This was my part of the project where I could show how good I am at representing data cleanly, readable and making the user experience pleasant.
